i2b2 client implementation
--------------------------

Lightweight client implementation to authenticate with
an i2b2 hive, manage users/roles and run queries.

If you want to access an existing i2b2 installation or server,
look at the data at /webclient/i2b2_config_data.js from your desired
target server, to find the values of `urlProxy`, `urlCellPM`
and `domain`, to find out what to specify in setProxy, setPM 
and setAuthorisation.

For more documentation, see Javadoc in /src/main/java/de/sekmi/li2b2/client/Li2b2Client.java
